# Machine Learning Algorithms

### By Abdullah Aleem

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of some machine learning algorithm written for python.
Although there are amazing libraries available, using my own implementation allows to accomodate changes in the algorithm with respect to the task and data available.
I also tried making hyperparameter tuning easier, using inbuilt functions.

## Algorithms

This collection has following algoithms:-
* Decision Tree (dt.py)
* KNN (knn.py)
* Percepton (perceptron.py)
* Linear Classifer with Gradient Descendent (linear.py and gd.py)
     * Squared Loss 
     * Logistic Loss
     * Hinge Loss   
* Multiclass Classifiers (multiclass.py)
     * One vs All
     * All vs All
     * MC Tree
* Clustering (clustering.py)
     * FirstK
     * Random
     * Further First Heuristic
     * KMeans++
