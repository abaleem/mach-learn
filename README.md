# Mach Master

Collection of some machine learning algorithm written for python. <br>
For complete guide on how to use please see 'mach.ipynb' or [Click Here](https://github.com/abaleem/mach-master/blob/master/mach.ipynb)
<br>

This collection has following algoithms:-
* Supervised
    * Decision Tree (dt.py)
    * KNN (knn.py)
    * Percepton (perceptron.py)
    * Linear Classifer with Gradient Descendent (linear.py and gd.py)
        * Squared Loss
        * Logistic Loss
        * Hinge Loss   
     * Multiclass Classifiers (multiclass.py)
        * One vs All
        * All vs All
        * MC Tree

* Unsupervised
    * Clustering (clustering.py)
        * FirstK
        * Random
        * Further First Heuristic
        * KMeans++


Although there are several libraries available the reasons I compliled my own is:

1. To better understand the algorithms.
2. To changes in algorithm with respect to the task and data available.
3. Make it easy to tune hyperparameter, using inbuilt functions.

Lastly, feel free to use any of this code. Although this only contains a handful of algorithms but Ill keep on adding more in the future.
